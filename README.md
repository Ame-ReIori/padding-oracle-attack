# Padding Oracle Attack

A small project written in Golang in winter vacation when boring.

At first, I want tp use Rust to implement it. But emmm...., Rust is too haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard...... It's lifetime is complex, so I finally use Golang. 

It works well when plaintext is short and visible. But there is still a bug and I'm lazy to fix it.
